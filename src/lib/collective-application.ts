/**
 * AI Operator Collective application questions, scoring, calendar routing,

 *
 * Source of truth for the form (ApplyForm.tsx + EmbedApplyForm.tsx) and
 * the API validator at /api/community/apply.
 *
 * Refreshed per Jess's typeform-application-spec.md (2026-05-06):
 *  - 8 application questions after removing redundant Typeform steps.
 *  - Three-tier routing: Green (book a call), Yellow (we'll review +
 *    follow up), Red/Nurture (waitlist).
 *  - Hard gates that drop applicants into Yellow/Red regardless of
 *    numeric score: hours <5/wk, refusal of outreach, or
 *    "not ready to invest" → Yellow or Red.
 *  - Internal tier names (hot/warm/cold) preserved for downstream
 *    compatibility — they are mapped from the public routing tier:
 *    green↔hot, yellow↔warm, red↔cold.
